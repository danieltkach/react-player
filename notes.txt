  className={isPlaying ? "imageOff" : "imageOn"}
        alt={currentSong.name}
        src={currentSong.cover}
      >
      on the img tag
You need to pass in the isPlaying to the song class and then what the code is saying is: 
if the music is playing set the class of the image to one where the image is rotating 
and if not change it to one where its not.

The css looks like: 
img {
    width: 40%;
    border-radius: 50%;
    animation: spin 10s linear infinite;
    animation-play-state: paused;
  }
  @keyframes spin {
    from {
      transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    to {
      transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
  }
  .imageOn {
    animation-play-state: paused;
  }
  .imageOff {
    animation-play-state: running;
  }
